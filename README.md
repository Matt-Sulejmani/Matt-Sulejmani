<h3 align="left"> Skills and experience </h3>
My skillset in programming could be described as a "jack of all trades". I have experience in Full Stack development using React and Tailwind to create captivating frontend websites, Django and Flask to provide a reliable and versatile backend and Postgress as the SQL database. Full-Stack development is the area I have the most practice in, since I started my programming journey by learning how to make and deploy websites I have accumulated a decent amount of knowledge of how to create aestheitc frontend webpages and reliable backend servers using django. 

Going into more data driven applications like data analysis, machine learning and neural networks, most of my experience is with Python and libraries like numpy, matplotlib, pandas, scikit and pytorch. In terms of data analysis I like to separate my projects using Jupyter notebooks for more modular code whilst using the aforementioned libraries to analyse and visualize data. More recently in 2023 and 2024 I began experimenting with scikit and pytorch to improve my understanding of machine learning and neural networks. In 2025 I am to continue my ML initiatives with pytorch and tensorflow in order to make my own AI companion, while learning more about the different types of generative AI and machine learning algorithms.

Lastly I also enjoy writing performant or low-level code from time to time using either C++ or Rust. Due to the vast amount of libraries and information available for C++ I chose it over Rust in most scenarios. The CMake build system alongside Docker make it easy to make cross-platform code so I rarely have to worry about cross-compatibility between OS-s or which IDE to use. I am confident in my OOP principles in C++ and my ability to read, understand and document code. My goal with C++ this year is to write my own physics engine or engineering toolbox to help me with my work in university as an aerospace student.
